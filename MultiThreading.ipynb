    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python?\n",
    "Ans1. Multithreading in Python is a technique of running multiple threads of execution simultaneously within a single process. Each thread runs concurrently and independently of each other, and they share the same memory space.\n",
    "In Python, the threading module is used to handle threads. This module provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating and managing threads. It allows you to create new threads, start them, and communicate between them using various synchronization primitives such as locks, events, and semaphores."

    "Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to be more responsive to user inputs, since one thread can handle user input while another thread is running a lengthy task in the background.\n",
    "Better Resource Utilization: By using multiple threads, a program can make better use of system resources like CPU and memory, resulting in improved performance.\n",

    "Increased Complexity: Multithreading can make code more complex and harder to debug, as it can introduce issues like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions?\n",
    "Ans6. Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource, which they currently hold. As a result, none of the threads can proceed further, and the program becomes stuck in an infinite loop. This can happen when two threads each hold a resource that the other thread needs to proceed.\n",
    "A race condition is a situation where the output of a program depends on the sequence or timing of the execution of multiple threads. This can happen when two or more threads access a shared resource, such as a variable or a file, and the output of the program depends on the order in which these threads access the resource."
